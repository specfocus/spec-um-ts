# Naming convention

In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:

* To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;[1]
* To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
* To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

Common conventions are:

* lowerCamelCase
* kebab-case
* snake_case
* UpperCamelCase

Our custom conventions are

* URLs: kebab-case
* Databases: snake_case
* Javascript: lowerCamelCase
* Typescript: UpperCamelCase for types
